            "Although the negative energy many expressed about the current economic expansion was dismissed out of hand, it was important to remember that the economic expansion is a long road to recovery;\n",
            "that the expansion is not the function of the economy, but of the major economic parties; and\n",
            "that the American people demand a hearse from the government when they need it, not when they can get it back.\n",

            "Nevertheless, we must continue to reduce the opportunities for abuse that occur when government actions become overly aggressive in pursuing its objectives.\n",
            "The free trade agreement that I have negotiated with our trading partners has shown very little to suggest that the United States will continue to be a safe haven for unfair trading practices.\n",
            "The large trade deficit that has evolved during this expansion has subjected our free and fair trade policy to much criticism, especially from the Congress.\n",

            "For the first time in our expansion, the business investment pie has been reduced 5 percent.\n",
            "The expansion has been characterized by unusually strong real business investment starting in 1981.\n",

            "We know that economic recoveries have not been stable in either duration or magnitude, in part because monetary and fiscal policies have often been erratic.\n",
            "We may not be able to eliminate recessions entirely, but a sustained commitment to policies that promote long-term growth and stability can reduce their frequency and severity.\n",

            "Our 1981 Program for Economic Recovery was designed for the long run with priority attention to the major problems we faced at that time.\n",
            "Our second-term Program for Growth and Opportunity represents a continuation and expansion of the earlier program, with priority attention to the major problems we face in 1985 and beyond.\n",
            "Our objectives—economic growth, stability of the general price level, and increased individual economic opportunity—have not changed.\n",
            "Federal economic policy will continue to be guided by the four key elements of the earlier program.\n",
            "Our progress in solving the most important economic problems we inherited in 1981, however, has allowed us to refocus our attention on the remaining problems and to shift our priorities and resources toward their solution.\n",
            "Several significant problems remain to be addressed.\n",
            "The rate of growth of Federal spending has been substantially reduced from the rate projected in the budget we inherited in fiscal 1981, but spending growth continues to outpace the economy.\n",
            "Spending too much has left us with a large budget deficit that must and will be reduced.\n",
            "In our efforts to reduce the deficit, we must not forget that the cause of the deficit is increased spending and insufficient growth, not decreased taxes.\n",
            "Federal tax receipts are now almost the same share of gross national product as in the late 1970s, even after the substantial reduction in tax rates that we initiated in 1981.\n",
            "Another economic problem demanding resolution is unemployment and its effects on the Nation’s workers and families.\n",
            "Despite significant progress, much remains to be done.\n",
            "More than 6 million more Americans are now employed than in January 1981, but the unemployment rate is still too high.\n",
            "We will not be satisfied until every American who wants a job is employed at a wage that reflects the market value of his or her skills.\n",
            "Another aspect of this problem is that the poverty rate remains stubbornly high, despite a strong recovery and a continued increase in government assistance.\n",
            "Also, although the inflation rate has been reduced substantially, it is still higher than during most of our peacetime history prior to 1965.\n",
            "We will not be satisfied until we have totally and permanently wrung inflation out of our economy.\n",
            "Work also remains to be done in the areas of regulatory and monetary policy.\n",
            "Many Federal regulations still impose a substantial cost to the economy.\n",
            "In addition, we need to strengthen the commitment to a sound monetary policy that never again retards economic growth, or reaccelerates inflation.\n",
            "Our trade deficit, another area of concern, has been caused in large part by a strong dollar.\n",
            "Investors around the world have bid up the dollar as they have become increasingly confident in our economy.\n",
            "That confidence is an asset and not a liability.\n",
            "However, the conditions that have led to the trade deficit have increased the obstacles faced by some important industries.\n",
            "Agriculture, one of our most productive export sectors, has been harmed by a combination of rigid and outdated Federal agricultural policies and subsidized foreign competition as well as by the strong dollar.\n",
            "Some of our import-competing industries, such as steel, have also been hurt by subsidized foreign competition and the strong dollar.\n",
            "In one respect the trade deficit is like the budget deficit;\n",
            "both are too large to be sustained, but there are both beneficial and detrimental ways to reduce them.\n",
            "Our goal is a system of free and fair trade in goods, services, and capital.\n",
            "We will work toward this goal through both bilateral and multilateral agreements.\n",
            "Economic conditions during the past 4 years are best characterized as transitional—\n",
            "from a period of low productivity growth to a period of high productivity growth;\n",
            "from a period of high inflation and interest rates to a period of much lower inflation and interest rates;\n",
            "from a period of economic “malaise” to a period of economic opportunity.\n",

            " or the American people, that our tax system should be indexed to inflation, and that our tax system should be able to respond to every rise and fall in the tax system with a robust and comprehensive reform of our tax code.\n",
            "Our tax system needs basic reform.\n",
            "It is extraordinarily complicated;\n",
            "it leads to substantial economic inefficiency; and\n",
            "it is widely perceived to be unfair.\n",
            "Although my Administration has been successful in reducing much of the legislation, a continued increase in Government interference in the economy would be a much greater threat to our Nation’s economic health than would any change in tax laws.\n",
            "In addition, the Constitution authorizes the Congress “To coin Money (and) regulate the Value thereof,” and Congress has delegated this authority to the Federal Reserve System.\n",
            "The role of the executive branch is restricted to advising the Congress and the Federal Reserve about the conduct of monetary policy, and to nominating members of the Board of Governors as positions become vacant.\n",
            "During my first term, the Federal Reserve reduced the rate of money growth relative to the high rates of the late 1970s.\n",
            "This change in policy, assisted by the related strong increase in the exchange value of the dollar, helped produce a substantial reduction of inflation and market interest rates.\n",
            "On occasion, however, the rate of money growth has been quite volatile, contributing to instability in interest rates and a decline in economic activity.\n",
            "The sharp reduction in money growth through mid-1982, for example, undoubtedly added to the length and severity of the 1981–1982 recession.\n",
            "And a similar reduction in money growth in the second half of 1984 contributed to the temporary slowing of economic growth late in the year.\n",
            "We reaffirm our support for a sound monetary policy that contributes to strong, steady economic growth and price stability.\n",
            "Moreover, we expect to cooperate closely with the Federal Reserve in defining and carrying out a prudent and predictable monetary policy.\n",
            "Conclusion\n",
            "The Federal Government has only a few important economic responsibilities.\n",
            "Given a proper conduct of these important roles, additional Federal intervention is more often a part of the problem than a part of the solution.\n",
            "We should continue to reduce the many less-important economic activities of the Federal Government so that individuals, private institutions, and State and local governments will have more resources and more freedom to pursue their own interests.\n",
            "Good stewardship of our constitutional responsibilities and the creative energies of the American people will ensure a future of continued economic growth and opportunity.\n",
            "\n",
            "TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:\n",
            "The major economic objectives of my Administration from its beginning have been strong, sustainable, noninflationary economic growth and expanding economic opportunities for all Americans.\n",
            "To achieve these goals, we have pursued policies that are in the long-term best interest of the Nation.\n",
            "The benefits of this approach are now clear.\n",
            "The economy has entered the fourth year of a robust expansion that has dramatically increased opportunities for all Americans.\n",
            "Millions of new jobs have been created.\n",
            "Investment opportunities have increased.\n",
            "Standards of living have risen.\n",
            "Moreover, this success has been accomplished without rekindling inflation.\n",
            "We are committed to continuing and extending policies that encourage the private investment and innovation that are the foundation of this expansion.\n",
            "We continue to resist unnecessary increases in government spending and unwarranted interference in private markets.\n",
            "Sustained, strong economic growth depends critically on allowing the market system to function as freely as possible.\n",
            "Free markets provide proper incentives to work, save, and invest, and they ensure that the interests of consumers are served.\n",
            "These basic principles were embodied in our 1981 Program for Economic Recovery and reaffirmed in the second-term Program for Growth and Opportunity.\n",
            "These programs do not offer “quick fixes” but rely on the inherent ability of the free market system to allocate resources efficiently and to generate economic prosperity.\n",
            "The fundamental responsibility of the Federal Government should be to provide a stable environment within which people can make economic decisions, not to make those decisions for them.\n",
            "To this end, our initial program involved four essential elements:\n",
            "•\n",
            "Restrain the growth of Federal spending,\n",
            "•\n",
            "Reduce personal and business taxes,\n",
            "•\n",
            "Reduce regulatory excesses, and\n",
            "•\n",
            "Encourage stable and moderate monetary growth.\n",
            "THE CURRENT EXPANSION\n",
            "The success of our policies is now apparent.\n",
            "Even though economic growth slowed a bit in 1985 compared with its strong performance in 1983 and 1984, the expansion has nonetheless proceeded at an encouraging pace.\n",
            "It is already 4 months longer in duration than the average peacetime expansion since World War II.\n",
            "If the expansion continues as expected throughout 1986, it will be the third longest in the postwar period.\n",
            "This expansion has been characterized by unusually strong real business investment in plant and equipment due to our successful attack on inflation and to our tax policy, which stimulated investment.\n",
            "Real business investment has contributed nearly twice as much to real gross national product (GNP) growth in this expansion as it typically has in previous postwar expansions;\n",

            "Trade in goods and services is only one aspect of our economic relations with the rest of the world.\n",
            "The international flow of capital into the United States and from the United States to other countries is also of great importance.\n",
            "The United States should play a primary role in preserving the vitality of the international capital market.\n",
            "Severe strains on that market developed in 1982 as several nations found it difficult to service their overseas debt obligations.\n",
            "In 1982, the Federal Government worked closely with debtor and creditor nations and the major international lending agencies to prevent a disruption in the functioning of world capital markets.\n",
            "Now, with the cooperation of a wide variety of creditors, countries with especially severe debt-servicing difficulties are establishing economic and financial programs that will permit them to meet their international obligations.\n",
            "The Years Ahead\n",
            "We are now at a critical juncture for the American economy.\n",
            "The recession has led to strong pressures from some members of the Congress and from others to abandon our commitment to a policy that is aimed at long-term economic growth, capital accumulation, and price stability.\n",
            "There are many who urge new government spending programs and forcing the Federal Reserve to raise monetary growth rates to levels that would rekindle inflation.\n",
            "I am convinced that such policies would prove detrimental to the long-run interests of the American people.\n",
            "Our economy, despite the recession, is extraordinarily resilient and is now on the road to a healthy recovery.\n",
            "It is essential in the year ahead that the Administration and the Congress work together, take a long-term perspective, and pursue economic policies that lead to sustained economic growth and to greater prosperity for all Americans.\n",
            "\n",
            "To the Congress of the United States:\n",
            "I have long believed that the vitality of the American economy and the prosperity of the American people have been diminished by inappropriate policies of the Federal Government:\n",
            "unnecessary government regulations that discouraged initiative and wasted scarce capital and labor;\n",
            "an inefficient and unfair tax system that penalized effort, saving, and investment;\n",
            "excessive government spending that wasted taxpayers’ money, misused our Nation’s resources, and created budget deficits that reduced capital formation and added to the burden of the national debt; and\n",
            "monetary policies that produced frequent business cycles and a path of increasing inflation.\n",
            "I came to Washington to change these policies.\n",
            "The needed reforms are far from complete, but substantial progress can already be seen:\n",
            "the burden of regulation has been reduced,\n",
            "tax rates have been lowered and the tax structure improved,\n",
            "government spending on a wide range of domestic programs has been curtailed, and\n",
            "a sound monetary policy has been established.\n",
            "Although the full favorable effect of those reforms on our Nation’s rate of economic growth will take time to develop, some of the benefit of our economic policies is already visible in the current recovery.\n",
            "The economy’s performance in 1983 was very gratifying to me.\n",
            "The 3.2 percent rise in consumer prices between 1982 and 1983 was the lowest rate of inflation since 1967.\n",
            "The recovery produced a sharp drop in unemployment and a substantial increase in the income of American families.\n",
            "The number of people at work increased by more than 4 million and the unemployment rate fell from a high of 10.7 percent in December 1982 to 8.2 percent in December 1983.\n",
            "The 6.1 percent rise in real gross national product (GNP) last year means that real annual income per person in the United States rose $700.\n",
            "Reducing Unemployment\n",
            "Despite the substantial reduction in unemployment, the number of unemployed workers remains unacceptably high.\n",
            "Continued economic recovery will mean millions of additional jobs in the years ahead and further declines in the rate of unemployment.\n",
            "In 1984 alone, the American economy is expected to add more than 3 million additional jobs.\n",
            "By the end of the decade, we will need 16 million new jobs to absorb a growing labor force.\n",
            "Only a strong and expanding economy can provide those jobs while achieving a progressively lower level of unemployment over the next 6 years.\n",
            "Although economic growth is by far the most important way to reduce unemployment, special policies to help the structurally unemployed and particularly disadvantaged groups can also be helpful.\n",
            "To assist these individuals in developing job-related skills that will lead to productive careers in the private sector, I proposed the Job Training Partnership Act that I signed into law in 1982.\n",
            "Last year I proposed additional measures to increase opportunities for training and retraining.\n",
            "Although the Congress has enacted some of my employment proposals, I am still waiting for congressional action on others.\n",
            "Of particular concern to me is the unemployment among teenagers.\n",
            "Such unemployment is not only a problem in itself, but is also indicative of lost opportunities to acquire on-the-job training and job-related skills.\n",
